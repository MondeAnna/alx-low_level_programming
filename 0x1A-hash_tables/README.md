### [ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/) System Engineering Plus

Studies carried out in the **[ALX Software Engineering Plus](https://www.alxafrica.com/software-engineering-plus/)** course

<br />

#### Technologies

* Bash:     5.1-6ubuntu1
* Docker:   24.0.5
* GCC:      9.4.0
* Python:   3.8.5
* Ubuntu:   20.04 LTS

<br />

#### Learning Objectives

* At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to `explain to anyone`, **without the help of Google**:
    * What is a hash function
    * What makes a good hash function
    * What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them
    * What is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table
    * What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
    * What are the most common use cases of hash tables
    * The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `hash_tables.h`

#### Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects

As from this project:

* Based on the requirements of each task, **you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first**, before you actually code anything
* The intranet checks for Python projects won't be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD and think about all possible cases
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don't miss any edge case. **But not in the implementation of them!**
* **Don't trust the user**, always think about all possible edge cases
